Simple Keylogger
A simple keylogger is a basic program designed to record the keys pressed on a keyboard and typically save this information to a log file. Its core function is to capture keystrokes, focusing on logging each key press in the order it occurs. More advanced versions might include timestamps or information about the application in use, but the fundamental purpose remains the discreet recording of keyboard input.
